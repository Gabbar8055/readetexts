The Books tab above will let you search through the offline catalog of Project Gutenberg, an Internet repository of
free etexts featuring books in many languages.

The catalog used contains 26,869 titles, all out of copyright in the United States.  The catalog is current as of
January 29, 2009.  For titles added after that date you should visit http://www.gutenberg.org.

To find a book, type one or more words that would be in the author's name or the title, then press Enter.  The list will only
include books that match all the words, so use fewer words to make the list longer and more words to shorten the list. 
If an author goes by his intials (like H.G. Wells, P.G. Wodehouse, or E.E. Smith) you may need to try both the initials and the
complete first name to get every title available.  If you use a well known author's name like "Shakespeare" you will
get titles both by and about him.

To download the book select it in the list and press the download button next to the search box.  You may download
several books to the Journal in the same session by using the "Keep" button on the Activity tab after each one except
the final one, which will be saved to the Journal when you exit this Activity.

There are two kinds of "paths" listed in the table.  The older file naming convention on the Project Gutenberg 
website has a path that begins with "/etext".  These represent the oldest files in the archive, and the paths are
occasionally wrong.  The new file naming convention uses just numbers: /1/9/0/3/19033 for example.  If there
are two entries for the same book, choose the one using the new naming convention.

Press the Escape key to hide the search results table and start reading.
